# Henry README



Within this folder, there are 3 subfolders which your attention should be directed towards. These are 

- [ ] `gas-code-test-nonmpi` - a copy of the code *without* any MPI/parallel additions
- [ ] `gas-code-test-mpi` - my copy of the code *wit* MPI/parallel additions and further refinements
- [ ] `Res` - the folder containing:
  - [ ] My results
  - [ ] A short notes document explaining the setup and solution

---

*Please feel free to investigate the `gas-code-test-sandbox` folder but note this is not my final "production" response. In the interests of disclosure, I also made some modifications to the plotting script so that figures are saved as `PDFs`.*
